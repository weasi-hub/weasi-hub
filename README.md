### Hi there 👋 I'm Weasi

🌱 I'm currently growing my skills in **frontend web development** — building and sharing projects using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**, while actively learning **JavaScript**.

🛠️ Most of my repositories include practice work such as:
- Responsive landing pages and layouts
- Modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- Form structures and UI components
- JavaScript experiments and interactive features (in progress)

🎯 My goal is to become a skilled frontend developer, one project at a time. I'm focused on learning best practices, writing clean code, and exploring new tools as I grow.

📫 I'm always open to feedback, advice, or collaboration. Feel free to reach out or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alweasi15).

Thanks for visiting my GitHub! 🚀
